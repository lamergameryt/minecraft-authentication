Server Authenticator is a **Spigot plugin** with you can require users to authenticate themselves upon joining the server. 

This plugin was made by me in the **year 2017** ago. This is the reason the code qualitiy is poor.
If I find this repository get semi-popular, I'll update the code to improve its quality.  

## How to use this?
To compile this plugin, you will need the required dependencies. This project has no external dependencies other than **Spigot** itself.

The project was made with Spigot version `spigot-1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-latest` and this is the recommended version too. To export this plugin as a jar file, build this plugin with Spigot as a dependency.

Once this plugin is built as a jar file, you can drag and drop it into your `plugins` folder.

## Permissions
This plugin has only two permissions:
* `serverauth.resetcommand`: Required to execute the command `/serverauth reset` which is used to reset the player's password.
* `serverauth.reloadcommand`: Required to execute the command `/serverauth reloadconfig` which is used to reload the configuration file. 

## Is this secure?
The players passwords are hashed with the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.
According to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6776050/how-long-to-brute-force-a-salted-sha-512-hash-salt-provided), a String hashed with SHA-512 will take approximately **3.17 * 10^64 years**.

Hence it is safe to say that the neither the admins, nor anyone trying to bruteforce the password is going to get the original password anytime soon.
